# Portable_Weather_Station
My bachelor's thesis project using Raspberry Pi as a weather station.

Abstract
The topic that often appears as an engineering project seems to be worn out. In
general, it focused on a simple microprocessor system (most often Arduino, STM32), the
selection of popular sensors and writing simple software. In the proposed topic, we want
to focus on the functionality of the station and testing the tool called Docker. The station
will be based on a Raspberry PI 4b system with a minimum 4 GB RAM memory, so
that it is possible to install Docker. A software for recording data from sensors should be
written, but it should be run in a container (an appropriate container should be created).
Also, communication between the weather station and the outside world (e.g. a cloud)
should be based on appropriate containers.
